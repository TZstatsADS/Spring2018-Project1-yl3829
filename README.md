### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Time vs Inaugural speech
+ This project is conducted by Yanjun Lin

+ Project summary: 
We want to see how inaugural speech on time scale would be related or different. 
In the exploration below, we applied LSA and LDA and found that the speech is actually quite relevant with time in the form of latent sentiment and topics clustering. 
In the end we discovered that President Trump's speech is quite different from his recent predecessors, which also confirms the fact that President Trump has a different background, values and action.
