### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Does inaugural speeches evolve over time?
+ This project is conducted by Yanjun Lin, YL3829.

+ Project summary:   
We want to see does inaugural speeches evolve over time. If so, then how inaugural speech on time scale would be related or different. Will there be a trend of these speeches over time?   
In the exploration, we applied LSA and LDA and found that the speeches are actually quite relevant with time in the form of latent semanteme and topics clustering. We could see there is trend in the recent speeches from the result of LSA. In the end we also discovered that President Trump's speech is quite different from his recent predecessors, which also confirms the fact that President Trump has a different background, values, action as well as the way he makes speeches.
